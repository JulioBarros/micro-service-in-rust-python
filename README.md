# Micro Service Demo

Sample code demonstrating a simple micro service in a few languages.

This code accompanies the article [Building a Micro-Service in Rust and Python](https://E-String.com/articles/building-a-micro-service-in-rust-and-python/)

The basic idea is to create a simple understandable service that could be used to learn Rust and compare with Python which I'm more familiar with.

This is a simple system but it is easy to imagine a scenario where it would be useful to:

- act as a cache for an expensive/slow service
- act as a proxy for authorization purposes
- abstract and standardize one or more APIs
- enrich or combine the data itself in useful ways
